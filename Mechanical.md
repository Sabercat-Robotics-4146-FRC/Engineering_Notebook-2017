## *Drivetrain Design*
The drive train was built for versatility, robustness, and modularity. Design was heavily influenced by our manufacturing capabilities. Our primary manufacturing facility has tooling for sheet metal, so we designed most of the robot, including the drivetrain, in sheet metal. The decision was reinforced by the sheet metal design tools provided by Solidworks. We used 6061-T6 alloy 0.0625” sheets for a majority of parts.
### Drive Wheels
We chose to use 8” OD pneumatic wheels for our robot this year. The wheels allow us to regulate the speed and traction by setting the pressure of the wheels.

We used these wheels for their high traction. This will provide a higher grip when being defended against. A six (6) wheel skid drive train is used; three (3) wheels on each side of the drivetrain. These wheels are belted together using HTD 15mm belts. Although belts are more prone to slipping, they are lighter than chain and gears. The weight of the wheels was a concern; all six (6) drive wheels weigh approximately 10.8 lbs. The wheels alone would be nine percent (9%) of the total robot weight, assuming a 120lb robot.

### Drive Power and Reduction

In the 2017 season, speed and agression is a must have for a drive train. The game is less about what can be accomplished and more about how efficient the task is accomplished. When designing the drive train, the motor power and reduction is one of the most important features of the drive train. The dirve power determines the speed of the robot, which is directly proportional to scoring rates, and how much your robot can push and avoid pushing. Pushing is most important in finals. When the motor is geared for torque over speed, the robot will be more consistant because it cannot be blocked as easily.
